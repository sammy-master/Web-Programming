<h1><i><u>Introduction:-</u></i></h1>
<p style="color:#FF7F7F "> “Hello, my name is <u><b>Saksham Sharma</b></u> and I’m a computer science major. I have experience with several programming languages, including Java, Python, and SQL.
<br> I’m particularly interested in artificial intelligence and machine learning, and I’m currently working on a project that involves developing an AI-powered chatbot.
<br>Last semester, I learned C Programming. I learned a lot about software development processes and project management during that experience.
<br>This semester, I am Learning C++ Programming and rescheduling my time table to increase my productive time and learn more things.
<br>After graduation, I hope to work as a software engineer at a tech company, where I can continue to develop my skills and contribute to innovative projects. In my free time, I enjoy attending hackathons and learning about new technologies in the field."
